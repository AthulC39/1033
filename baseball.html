                <p>
                    Baseball is another popular sport in North America. Although baseball is considered one of the most popular sports even in Canada, there are very few professional players who come from Canada. The vast majority come from the US and Central and South America. However, Canada does have many minor leagues with local players.
                </p>

                <h2 class="mediumHeader">London Majors</h2>
                <p>The London Majors are a minor league baseball team in the IBL (Intercounty Baseball League). This league consists of 8 teams all based in Southern Ontario. The Majors won back-to-back IBL championships in 2021 and 2022. The Majors play in Labatt Memorial Park across the street from the Fork of the Thames in downtown London. The Labatt Memorial Park is considered the world's oldest baseball field still being used today and only underwent minor changes from the way it was when it was first open in 1877!</p>

                <h2 class="mediumHeader">Toronto Blue Jays</h2>
                <p>The Toronto Blue Jays are the only MLB (Major League Baseball) team based in a Canadian city. The Blue Jays play in Rogers Center (formerly called SkyDome) next to the CN Tower in downtown Toronto. The arena is well known for its convertible-like roof that is typically open for most home games but closes for rainy games and when the arena isn't being used.
                </p>
                <p>The Blue Jays have made it to the World Series championships twice and won both times. They were in consecutive years in 1992 and 1993. Since then, the Blue Jays haven't had much success in the post-season, usually not making it at all or getting eliminated early in the playoffs, much like their hockey counterpart, the Leafs.</p>
